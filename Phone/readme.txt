Inspired by "Phone/Tablet Stand - Flat fold - Print in place!" by jonnig on 
Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3146835

This is non print in place phone stand with Sketchup source file.
Some assembly are required. There are 2 versions - with either wire from 
paper clip or 1.75mm filament as hinge pins.

- Hinges are more robust
- less filament use
- improved grooves
