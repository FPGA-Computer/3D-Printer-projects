This is a drive caddy for my drive bay mod.  It is much stronger as what you normally need as it is also 
acts as stiff top bracing for the cut ends of the drive bays panels.  The latch handles are still not 
stiff enough for my taste, but the drive is latched pretty tight.

The drive block is printed vertically without support with the closed end side ont print plate.  The caddy
can be printed without support.
