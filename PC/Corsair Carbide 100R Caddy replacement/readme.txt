This is a replacement HDD Caddy for Corsair 100R case.  I have not bother with the
2.5" drive screws.  I made a few adjustments to the ejector design for 3D printing.

Support is needed on the bottom of the 2 rails.  I use Support: Normal(manual)
and adaptive fill.  Default setting for everything else.
